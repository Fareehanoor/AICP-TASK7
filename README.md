# AICP-TASK7

The manager of a supermarket needs a program to record donations to charity. Each customer has
the choice of three charities to donate to, and 1% of their shopping bill will be donated to the chosen
charity.
Write and test a program for the manager.
Your program must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data.
Error messages and other outputs need to be set out clearly.
All variables, constants, and other identifiers must have meaningful names.
You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested.
TASK 1 – Set up the donation system
Set up a routine that allows:
the names of three charities to be input and stored
the charity names to be displayed with a number (1, 2 or 3) beside each name
a choice of 1, 2 or 3 to be entered to choose the charity, all other entries rejected
the value of a customer’s shopping bill to be entered
the donation to be calculated
three totals to be set to zero ready to total each charity donation
TASK 2 – Record and total each donation
For a customer’s shopping bill:
input a charity choice of 1, 2 or 3
input the value of a customer’s shopping bill
calculate the donation
add the donation to the appropriate total
Output the name of the charity and the amount donated.
TASK 3 – Show the totals so far
Extend TASK 2 to accept:
donations from more customers
a charity choice of -1 to show the totals so far
Display the charities’ names and the totals in descending order of totals.
